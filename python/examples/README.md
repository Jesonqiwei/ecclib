# ecclib python API examples

These examples are intended to illustrate usage of the basic ECC primatives. 
They exercise the major features of the Python API for curves and point. There
are also interoperable equivalents using the [C API](../../examples/) and the
[Go API](../../ecgo/cmd/). In general the python examples work just like the C
examples so you should be able to use the same script to walk through their
execution.

Please refer to the [C Examples](../../examples/) for tutorial on how the
examples work. If that doesn't work, try the "--help" option.
