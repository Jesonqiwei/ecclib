README for libecc:

libecc provides basic elliptic curve math functions which can be used
to implement higher level cryptography algorithms. 

libecc follows the traditional GNU autotools build process so it _should_
build without issue on most platforms where autotools is present. GMP is the
only dependency. 

Example build and install sequence:

$ autoreconf --install
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr
$ make
$ make check
$ sudo make install
